          Ecobear was my group's submission to the IDEO x Invention Corps Spring 2024 Designathon 
          held on the University of California, Berkeley campus. We won 2nd place from a total of 20 teams. 
        </p>
        <p class ="ContextSummary">Our prompt
          for the challenge was:</p>
        <p class="DesignathonPrompt"><strong style="color: #89ab9e">“How might we bring the little joys of gentle and emerging tech to 
          empower communities with sustainable living?”</strong></p>

        </p>
        <p class = "SustainableLivingTitle">Identifying What Aspect of Sustainable Living to Tackle</p>
        <p class = "SustainableLivingText">My group and I took the first hour and half to research and started to 
          jot down ideas using Fig-Jam.</p>
          <p class = "SustainableLivingText">We first wanted to identify avenues where <strong style="color: #89ab9e"> sustainable living </strong> is applicable.
             and landed on <strong style="color: #89ab9e">groccery shopping</strong> based on shared interests and potential for impact via research we conducted.</p>
          
          <p class = "SustainableLivingText">From our research, we found that the average U.S. household 
             emits 8 metric tons of CO2 per year, which is significantly above the sustainable target of 
             2 tons of CO2 per year set by the Paris Climate Agreement. As a result we wanted our app to <strong style="color: #89ab9e">empower users to make sustainable choices 
             while gorccery shopping </strong>
             by selecting organic items, items with recyclable packaging, and items with lower associated 
             carbon production to help reduce individual carbon footprint.</p>
        <p class = "EmergingTechnologyTitle">Picking An Emerging Technology</p>
        <p class = "EmergingTechnologyText">We decided to utilize AI for the emerging technology portion, as our team is most familiar 
          with it and can reasonably present the functionality in Figma.</p>
        <p class = "EmergingTechnologyText">Through discussions, we expanded on the idea to include a live mascot that provides affirmations for users' 
          sustainable choices and acts as a resource for users to ask questions while shopping. 
          Additionally, it would calculate the total impact of their choices, allowing users to see and understand upfront how their actions affect the environment.
        </p>
       <p class = "EmergingTechnologyText">This concept is supported by psychology research we conducted, which shows that:
        <ul class ="bullet-list">
          <li class = "PsychologyResearch">Positive feedback enhances positive emotional responses 
            and releases dopamine, making individuals feel good about their actions.
          </li>
          <li class = "PsychologyResearch">Consistent exposure to cues such as prompts and 
            affirmations our AI mascot would provide, help reinforce habits. 
          </li>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <p class = "SustainableLivingTitle"> Mission Statement </p>
      <p class = "MissionStatementText">With these foundations, we landed on EcoBear’s mission: </p>
      <p class = "MissionStatementFull"><strong style="color: #89ab9e">An online grocery platform that promotes sustainability and 
        enables consumers to make eco-friendly choices effortlessly, transforming

      <p class = "ReflectionText">This was my first time designing under time pressure. 
        It was an extremely rewarding experience, and I enjoyed collaborating with my team as we shared our design perspectives to create a 
        finished final product.
        <p class = "ReflectionText">From this expeirence, I had two main take aways:
        </p>
        <ul class ="bullet-list">
          <li class = "FunctionalityList"><strong style="color: #89ab9e">Being concise is critical:</strong> With only 2 minutes to present, it was important for us to cover the main point: the app. 
            Our idea was simple but had unique functionality. We found that other teams spent too much time on background and research, 
            leaving them insufficient time to fully present their deliverables.
          </li>
          <li class = "FunctionalityList"><strong style="color: #89ab9e">The Importance of taking time to ideate:</strong> 
            A key reason for our group's success was taking the time to finalize our idea rather than rushing into building the app immediately. 
            This thoughtful approach allowed us to create a more cohesive and well-thought-out product.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "ReflectionText">
          Overall this designathon, was an experience that showcased what it is like to work collaboratively on a design process. 
          It provided me with valuable learnings on how to successfully create designs in the future as well.
