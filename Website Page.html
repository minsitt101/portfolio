    <p class = "ContextTitle">Context</p>
    <p class="ContextSummary">
      After taking a student-taught Web Design course at UC Berkeley during my Spring 2024 term, I took what I learned to build my website that held all of my work!
    </p>
    <p class ="ContextSummary">I used a text-editor to write out the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for every page. This page will primarily go through my design process and what I learned from this experience!
      As this is my website, I was simultaneously the web designer and web developer, going through the whole design process</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "Goals">
    <p class = "GoalsTitle">Goals</p>
    <p class ="GoalsSummary">I researched multiple portfolios of other UI/UX designers and incorporated elements I liked as a viewer into my own designs.
      I also had to keep in mind my capabilities as someone who recently learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and if I would be able to trasnlate the design concepts.</p>

    <p class = "GoalsSummary">Thus, I looked for a presentation style that I knew I could implement and that was also organized concisely and intuitively for visitors.</p>

    <p class = "GoalsSummary">This led me to the overall design goal of the website: <strong style="color: #8798a8;">a minimalistic and calming aesthetic that is accessible on multiple interfaces
      to effecitvely presenting my projects</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div class = "WireframesSection">
    <p class = "WireframesTitle">Initial Wireframes</p>
    <p class ="WireframesSummary">With this goal in mind, I went ahead and produced the intiial Wireframes of the website.
    </p>
    <div class = Lo-Fi-Wireframes>
      <img src = "assets/Website Page cc & images/Website Initial Wirefraems.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class = "ColorSchemeSection">
    <p class = "ColorSchemesTitle">Picking a Color Scheme</p>
    <p class ="ColorSchemesSummary">With initial wireframes produced, I moved on figuring out a color scheme. This was arguanly the part where I was most indecisive was picking a color scheme for my website. I decided to have fun and pick colors
       that conveyed who I am and were personal to me while still working visually!
    </p>
    <p class ="ColorSchemesSummary">When designing my website, I wanted the color scheme to reflect my personality and create a specific atmosphere for visitors. 
      I chose soft and neutral beige tones to create a calming and inviting experience.
   </p>
    <div class = "ColorSchemeImage">
      <img src = "assets/Website Page cc & images/ColorScheme.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class = "DesignLogoSection">
    <p class = "DesignLogoTitle">Desgining A Logo</p>
    <p class ="DesignLogoSummary">As part of my research on other portfolios, I loved seeing the various logos people came up for their website and was inspired to create something unique for my website that reflects my Burmese heritage. 
      After much thought, I tried writing my name, “Min Sitt,” in Burmese script. The Burmese language naturally features elegant curves and intricate shapes, making it visually appealing. 
      Incorporating this into my logo not only adds a personal touch but also <strong style="color: #8798a8">celebrates my cultural background, creating a distinctive and meaningful design.</strong>
    </p>
    <div class = "LogoImage">
      <img src = "assets/Website Page cc & images/minsiit letters 3.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class = "Mid-Fidelity_Wireframes">
    <p class = "MidFiTitle">Mid-Fidelity/High-Fi Wireframes</p>
    <p class ="MidFiText">After deciding on the color-scheme, I went ahead to do mid-fi/high-fi prototypes of 
    the pages in Figma! </p>
    <p class = "PageSubtitile">Home Page</p>
    <p class ="MidFiText">I iterated over the home page several times before landing on a version that satisfied me. 
      My main problem was that the original design (below), it felt empty around the corners and was not visually engaging to the user. 
    </p>
    <div class = "HomePagePrototype1">
      <img src = "assets/Website Page cc & images/First Version.png">
    </div>
    <p class = "MidFiText"> To solve this, and to arrive to the final version of the home page I attempted several different things:
    </p>
    <ul class ="bullet-list">
      <li class = "MidFiBullet"><strong style="color: #8798a8">Adding miscellaneous elements to fill up the space:</strong> I tried the circle group designs, and while this did fill up the space, 
        it felt inconsistent to the overall theme I was trying to achieve, which was a clean and sharp design.
      </li>
      <div class = "HomePagePrototype2">
        <img src = "assets/Website Page cc & images/Version with Circles.png">
      </div>
      <li class = "MidFiBullet"><strong style="color: #8798a8">Redesigning my navigation bar:</strong> 
        As my navigation bar was originally in the center, i thought I would redesign it to push the navigation elements to the left and have a logo on the other side. 
        This ultimately filled the empty corners, whilst still maintaining a minimalistic visual. 
      </li>
      <li class = "MidFiBullet"><strong style="color: #8798a8">Adjusting typography:</strong> 
        The final change I made to get to the version. 
        By using a font with sharper points, a different color from the existing color scheme for my name, 
        and increasing the font size, it also helped fill the space but made the design more visually interesting as well.
      </li>
      <div class = "HomePagePrototype3">
        <img src = "assets/Website Page cc & images/Final Version of Home Page.png">
      </div>
    </ul>
    <p class = "PageSubtitile">Project Page and Showcase Page</p>
    <p class ="MidFiText">The mid-fi designs mostly remained the same from the lo-fi, and the final version (which you've probbably seen) had minor tweaks to typography 
      and how information was displayed in the Business Projects section.
    </p>
      <div class = "ProjectPagePrototype">
         <img src = "assets/Website Page cc & images/ProjectPageDisplay.png">
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class = "AccessibilitySection">
    <p class = "AccessibilityTitle">Keeping Accessibility In Mind</p>
    <p class ="AccessibilitySummary">I had initially designed my website suitable for full-screen, 
      it was important to make it suitable for other viewport sizes, such as mobile to make it accessible for all visitors.
    </p>
    <p class ="AccessibilitySummary">I primarily did this through media queries on CSS and adjusted the 
      styling from there. I prioritized using a <strong style="color: #8798a8">vertical-aligned design</strong> for smaller screen sizes, 
      which required reducing image sizes, changing code for how information was grouped, font-sizes, margins, and more. 
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class = "UserExperienceSection">
    <p class = "UserExperienceTitle">User Experience</p>
    <p class = "UserExperienceSummary">
      After building the bulk of the website, I began adding features to create a better experience for visitors:
    </p>
    <ul class ="bullet-list">
      <li class = "ReflectionBullet"><strong style="color: #8798a8">Scroll-Top-Button:</strong> Since a good portion of this website's content
        are long case studies, adding this button makes viewing more efficient for the user and allows them to get to other web pages faster.
      </li>
      <li class = "ReflectionBullet"><strong style="color: #8798a8">Animations:</strong> 
        I added animtions to make the website more interactive and less static. I also used them as visual aids such as when users hover over clickable items to 
        promote engagement.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class = "Reflection">
    <p class = "ReflectionTitle">Reflection</p>
    <p class = "ReflectionText">This was my first time designing under time pressure. 
      It was an extremely rewarding experience, and I enjoyed collaborating with my team as we shared our design perspectives to create a 
      finished final product.
      <p class = "ReflectionText">From this expeirence, I had two main take aways:
      </p>
      <ul class ="bullet-list">
        <li class = "ReflectionBullet"><strong style="color: #8798a8">Balancing Design and Implementation:</strong>  As someone looking to produce, 
          balancing design wants with the feasibility of implementation was a good experience. 
          It gave me a better understanding and even more appreciation of engineers who translate our designs into reality. 

        </li>
        <li class = "ReflectionBullet"><strong style="color: #8798a8">Persistence:</strong> 
          There was a lot of debugging throughout, and it required a lot of persistence to keep pushing and make progress. 
          Several times, I felt stumped on why certain elements weren’t being organized in the way I wanted, and viewing that problem
           as a challenge to solve rather than giving up made finding the solution even more satisfying. 
        </li>
        <li class = "ReflectionBullet"><strong style="color: #8798a8">Being Resourceful:</strong> 
          Building this  website also showed how important it was to be resourceful. 
          Whenever I was unsure of how to build something, I would seek public forums, YouTube videos, and more to see how other developers built out the solution and then tackled
          the problem again. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class = "ReflectionText">
        Overall, this was an extremely rewarding and challenging experience and allowed me to step into shoes of developing front-end and back-end.
