          Users order ahead for pickup, earn loyalty points for discounts, and can gift friends. 
          The app includes group-ordering discounts, in-app discounts, and a Venmo-like feed. 
          Its gamification feature, "Chicken Coop," rewards users with coins for gifting, 
          which can be exchanged for accessories to dress up virtual pet chickens.</p>

        <p class = "SummaryOfProblem">After three years of using Snackpass, I've only managed to claim free rewards once due to the unattainable and slow nature of the current reward system. 
          Consequently, I've found myself using Snackpass less frequently since there's little motivation unless it's purely convenient. 
          Additionally, the "Chicken Coop" gamification feature feels disconnected and lacks appeal for users, like myself, that are uninterested in dressing up virtual chickens. 
          
        <p class = "SummaryOfProblem">Thus, I asked: How would I <strong style ="color: #04BCFC">increase accessibility and statisfaction</strong> of the rewards system and 
          <strong style ="color: #04BCFC">modify and implement gamification elements</strong> to help Snackpass continue to set itself apart?</p>

                The goal is to generate more efficient point gifting and allow users to get points for stores they care about. 
                Since users indicate they want points from a particular set of stories, 
                this feature would help them progress within the rewards program more easily. 
                Users would be prompted to send points to their friends who specifically request it,

              Leaderboards traditionally is an effective gamification feature that makes users competiive and compare themselevs with others. Users at top rankings 
              feel a sense of accomplishment and recognition and are motivated to keep their ranks. In addition, non-compeittive users enjoy looking at leaderboards out of curioisity, and consume
              the information presented by them.</p>
            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              I saw an avenue to implement this in the context of a food-delivery app. Imagine seeing your friends is on the top leaderboard for ordering 50 bobas within the 
              span of 2 months! Likewise, seeing oneself on leaderboard provides motivation to maintain the position. Thus, the feautre's goal is to <strong style="color: #04BCFC">increase user engagement and social aspect of 
              Snackpass by creating conversations between users and providing them more incentives to engage with the app. </strong> My "Leaderboards" feature for Snackpass will have users be ranked
              based on specific categories and by store. Users will have the option to see how they rank around their friends and also all other users within the area.

              DESIGN CHOICES:
        </p>
            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">Faimiliarity:</strong> I researched how leaderboards were structured in mobile game apps that commonly rank player performance amongst
              sets of metrics. Through this, I adjusted the design (Wireframe #1 adjusted to Wireframe #2) for Snackpass's content but the manner in which information is presented is similar 
              to what you would find in gaming/sport mediums, making it concise and familiar.

            <p class = "LeaderboardText">

            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">Intuitive Placement: </strong> I put "Leaderboards" within the same area as "Trending", a page on Snackpass where users can see 
              what people are ordering from restaurants currently. "Trending" is reached by clicking the "Lightning" icon, and is currently the only page under that icon. Thus,
              placement of the Leaderboards under the "Lightning" icon is intuitive since both are data-oriented and informational pages.

              After conducting the user surveys, I decided to make a mind-map to highlight key pain-points of the Chicken Coop Feature and ideate solutions.

            <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">SncakCards:</strong> When designing the SnackCards, I used bright-colors and gradients to maintain the "fun" and "social" brand image

          <p class = "ChickencoopText">
            <strong style="color: #04BCFC;">Centralizing Features: </strong> In adjusting the Chicken Coop feature, I redesigned the page to have all related

        This was my first experience in making a personal project and taking control of understanding and designing a product to imrpove it! I had 
        a great learning experience in teaching myself Figma and understanding all the nunances behind the software. I also reseach mobile app design techniques and accesibility concepts
       to make sure that the designs I were making were as feasible as they could be. </p>
      <p class = "ReflectionText">
        An aspect of the project I would have done differently if I had time, is interview more business owners! Users like me are one-side of the coin,
        so I would want to survey restaurant partners with Snackpass how the rewards system affects their business to see if an more effective middle-ground
        can be achieved.
      </p>
      <p class = "ReflectionTextLast">
        Regardless, I am super proud of what I was able to achieve and my ability to learn new techniques and push myself out of my comfort zone. Since this was a personal
        project, I designed all assets and aspects of the project on my own alongst managing my coursework. However, I kept pushing since I know the end-result of redesigning and thinking 
        strategically on how to improve a product I use often is something I can be proud of!
