        <p class = "ContextSummary">Snackpass is a social food-pick-up app aimed at university students.
          Users order ahead for pickup, earn loyalty points for discounts, and can gift friends. 
          The app includes group-ordering discounts, in-app discounts, and a Venmo-like feed. 
          Its gamification feature, "Chicken Coop," rewards users with coins for gifting, 
          which can be exchanged for accessories to dress up virtual pet chickens.</p>

        <p class = "Quote">"Too many orders required to receive free rewards to incentivize me to take advantage of it.” - Surveyed Snackpass user</p>
        <p class = "SummaryOfProblem">After three years of using Snackpass, I've only managed to claim free rewards once due to the unattainable and slow nature of the current reward system. 
          Consequently, I've found myself using Snackpass less frequently since there's little motivation unless it's purely convenient. 
          Additionally, the "Chicken Coop" gamification feature feels disconnected and lacks appeal for users uninterested in dressing up virtual chickens. 
          To address these issues, I aimed to enhance satisfaction and accessibility by proposing features that help users obtain rewards faster and aimed to
          adjust current and add new gamification elements to increase user engagement overall to set Snackpass apart from other food pick-up/delivery apps.

          Before developing any higher-fidelity prototypes, I surveyed 50+ Snackpass users to validate pain-points and solutions I had in mind. 
          The survey was primarily aimed at understanding user gifting behavior, reward system attainability and opinions on the chicken coop feature. 
        </p>
        <p class = "ValidationSummary">Below are some main statistics and comments regarding user gifting behavior and the reward system:</p>

                The idea behind this feature is to allow users to set-up in their profile a "Favorite Store" they would like to get points from (Wireframe #2).
                This would then be communicated to all the user's friends during their chance to send a gift (Wireframe #3). The hope is to 
                generate more efficient point gifting and allow users to get points for stores they care about. This would help make the rewards program more attainabl
                and satisfying as users would be getting rewards for stores they enjoy.

            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              Leaderboards is an idea that came to mind since its a gamification feature that makes people compare themselevs and be competitive. Users at the top ranking can also
              feel a sense of accomplishment and recognition and thus would be motivated to keep thier ranks. It also is able to showcase information in an interesting way--for example, 
              imagine seeing someone order 80 bubble tea drinks in a year! This feature is thus aiming to increase user engagement and social aspect of Snackpass by creating conversations
              between users and providing them more incentives to engage with the app. </p>
            <p class = "LeaderboardText">
              For the design, I researched how leaderboards are structured in various apps,  particularly gaming apps, to understand the best way to present ranking information. 
               Created two initial sketches and proceeded with designing the second one, as it was more concise and focused in showcasing the information from 
               the first sketch such as rankings, categories, annd specific store the rankings are based by. I borrowed the concept from my first sketch of filtering
               based on the user's friends or local.

            <p class = "ChickencoopText">1. Link the Favorite Store feature to Chicken Coop by providing extra progress to hatching chicks if a

        This was my first experience in making a personal project and taking control of understanding and designing a product to imrpove it! I had 
        a great learning experience in teaching myself Figma and understanding all the nunances behind the software. I also reseach mobile app design techniques and accesibility concepts
       to make sure that the designs I were making were as feasible as they could be. </p>
      <p class = "ReflectionText">
        An aspect of the project I would have done differently if I had time, is interview more business owners! Users like me are one-side of the coin,
        so I would want to survey restaurant partners with Snackpass how the rewards system affects their business to see if an more effective middle-ground
        can be achieved.
      </p>
      <p class = "ReflectionTextLast">
        Regardless, I am super proud of what I was able to achieve and my ability to learn new techniques and push myself out of my comfort zone.Since this was a personal
        project, I designed all assets and aspects of the project on my own alongst managing my coursework. However, I ket pushing since I know the end-result of redesigning and thinking 
        strategically on how to improve a product I use often.
